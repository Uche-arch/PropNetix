          <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
          <p>
            To access certain features of the Platform, such as posting a
            listing or managing your profile, you must create an account. When
            you register, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete

            not to share your account information with third parties, and you

          <h2>4. Listings and Transactions</h2>
          <p>
            Users are permitted to post listings of products or services for
            sale or rent (hereafter referred to as "Listings"). By posting a
            Listing, you agree that the item or service is available for sale or
            rent, and that the description of the Listing is accurate, honest,
            and complies with these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a Listing is posted, it cannot be edited. If the Listing is no
            longer available for sale or rent, the user must delete the Listing.
            Upon the completion of a sale, the buyer and seller will connect
            directly to finalize the transaction. All transactions are strictly
            between the buyer and seller, and we do not intervene in these
            agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            PropNetix is not responsible for the accuracy, legality, or
            completeness of any Listings, nor do we guarantee the availability
            of any listed products or services.
