Okay now I want to give a fake testimonial on how I used propnetix to assist my neighbor in getting a shop
-- I told her i built it to solve the hunting stress, we search the platform together, and we saw a shop she'd like, we went ahead to contact the agent directly and the met, - negotiated a bit and boom, she got the shop, and she is running her foodstuff store now. She got the shop in less than 2 minutes, I saved her several days of aimless walking about, buringin of airtime making calls here and there, alot of transport, and this is exactly what PropNetix is about and built to do for us all.
Look at this testimonial, modify it well, and tell me what you think too. Use your highest, smartest brain.

-----------
Tweet version (example):
“Example of PropNetix in action: search ➜ pick a shop ➜ call agent ➜ meet & negotiate ➜ done in minutes. Less stress, more results.”

Founder Note (publishable)

“I built PropNetix to replace days of walking with minutes of smart search. Browse real listings, contact agents directly, meet, negotiate, and start. Simple, fast, and built for everyone who’s tired of the stress.”
----

Along with a video screen record. --
Imagine this: instead of walking around for days looking for a shop, you open PropNetix, search, spot a space you love, call the agent, meet, negotiate — and boom, you’ve got it. Minutes, not days. That’s the new way of space discovery we’re building at PropNetix.

Fine post, scout through our draft.


How can I add the number of listings at the top of each category, like the amount of listings we have there, like if it is 26 - I will see 25+, if it's 21 - I will see 20+, just something like that. I need it on the homepage and also the different categories page.


Okay now I want to use the chatgpt api stuff for the platform, let's carry it out, from the icon - dialog box - testing - how long - free - forever. But not out yet.


Now give me a good post to launch the ai chatbot for the patform, fire- jaw dropping post, like look like  - "AI powered platform, bla bla, I hope you understand. - Just make the post nice. Let people know I am going at great
